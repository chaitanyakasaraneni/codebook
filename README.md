# Codebook
### Inspiration
Our inspiration was the Facebook Developer Circle. Building the Developer Circle is a manual process and we aim to fill that gap. We created CodeBook - a social app to connect people with different skill-sets to connect locally, team up and build something awesome!

### What it does
CodeBook connects users of varied skills to connect and build together.
Our app uses Facebook's OAuth2 to sign in a person into the app. A user stores his skills and can search for people of required skills locally and be matched with coders in the local vicinity. These connected users/coders form a developer network. They plan, set goals and track their projects. One the group starts gaining some momentum, CodeBook enables them to join/create the local Facebook Developer Circles.

### How we built it
We used the react-native, expo for the front-end and amazon web services for the back-end. We also used Facebook's OAuth2 to help the user sign-up/sign-in to the app.
